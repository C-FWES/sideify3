# Sideify

Imagine a world where you can listen to music at any angle you desire. Sideify brings this to reality. 

## What is it?

Sideify allows you to rotate your music to any angle you would like; note how typically we listen to music as the sound waves are parsed from left to right. Sideify allows you to rotate these sound waves to create a whole new angular experience from any music you like. 

## Tools

Sideify was created on Vite + React, using Axios to interface with a Flask backend. 

## Special Thanks

To my good friend and hacking partner (https://github.com/PotatoShaga)[Daniel Bai], for suffering through the hours of audio research and debugging frustrations together with me.
